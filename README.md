# Prims-Algorithm-Implementation
Python code to implement Prim's algorithm. 
The program in "PrimAlgo.py" takes a graph and finds the shortest distance from source vertex to other vertices. 
It uses the graph and vertex datastructure from "RefGrAndVerBig.py" while processing

The graph data which has points and distances between the points is provided to the program. 
Currently the data is pre-fed in the main program.

#Scope for Improvement:
1. Provide the data (points and distances between the points) over a web graphical interface.
